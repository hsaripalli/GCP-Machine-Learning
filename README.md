# GCP-Machine-Learning
My lab sessions/ practice for Machine learning on Google Cloud Platform on Coursera


# 1. Flight Data
Improt a sample airline flight data from Google Big Query into a pandas data frame

# 2. Data Cleaning

The dataset is based on California's Vehicle Fuel Type Count by Zip Code report. This is a synthetic dataset that has been modified to make the data 'untidy'.
Objectives:

- Resolve missing values
- Convert the Date feature column to a datetime format
- Rename a feature column, remove a value from a feature column
- Create one-hot encoding features
- Understand temporal feature conversions

# 2. xploratory Data Analysis

Performed EDA on USAHousing dataset from Google Cloud Storage.

Objectives:

- Analyze a Pandas Dataframe
- Create Seaborn plots for Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
- Write a SQL query to pick up specific fields from a BigQuery dataset
- Exploratory Analysis in BigQuery


# 4. Linear Regression

Used the USA housing prices dataset from Kaggle to predict housing price. The data contains the following columns:
